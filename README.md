<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project
**What's an emulator?**

An emulator is a software program or hardware device that allows one computer system to behave like another computer system. In simpler terms, an emulator is like a magical translator for your computer to "imitate" the functions of another system. An emulator needs to understand the inner workings of the guest system in order to _trick_ the software into thinking it's running on the actual system. They are commonly used for running old software on new hardware, or in our case, playing games from older consoles on modern devices.
